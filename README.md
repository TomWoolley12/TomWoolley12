- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomWoolley12
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a decentralized music ecosystem using P.O.S consensus where artists and fans can stake in each other's work. I envision periodic (daily or weekly) rebalances of total token distribution. This will reward the most streamed artists while incentivizing fans and legacy token holders to remain invested in the network. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Additionally, I would like to learn some coding basics... I have a ways to go
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project and hear whether y'all think this is feasible.
- 📫 You can reach me at 267-800-4079 or my email: thomaswoolley1613@gmail.com
