- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomWoolley12
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a decentralized music ecosystem using P.O.S consensus where the biggest artists serve as the network's validators. Token distribution will rebalance on a daily or weekly basis based on contribution to the network. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Additionally, I would like to learn some coding basics... I have a ways to go
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a decentralized music platform
- 📫 You can reach me at 267-800-4079 or my email: thomaswoolley1613@gmail.com
